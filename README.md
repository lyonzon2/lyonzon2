A recent graduate passionate about technology and committed to developing creative, cost-effective, and easy-to-implement solutions. I'm currently transitioning into the cybersecurity field, focusing on Security Operations and Penetration Testing. 

---

## üéØ Objective

I started my journey in IT and networking, establishing a strong technical foundation. This led me to explore penetration testing, where I deepened my understanding of security vulnerabilities and attack strategies. Now, I aim to transition into a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** as a **Tier 1 Analyst**, ready to apply my hands-on experience in threat detection and analysis.
