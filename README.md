# üëã Hello, I'm Mohamed

[![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-belcadi-0a488b263)

A recent graduate passionate about technology and committed to developing creative, cost-effective, and easy-to-implement solutions. I'm currently transitioning into the cybersecurity field, focusing on Security Operations. 

---

## üéØ Objective

I started my journey in IT and networking, establishing a strong technical foundation. This led me to explore penetration testing, where I deepened my understanding of security vulnerabilities and attack strategies. Now, I aim to transition into a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** as a **Tier 1 Analyst**, ready to apply my hands-on experience in threat detection and analysis, incident response and digital forensics(DFIR).
